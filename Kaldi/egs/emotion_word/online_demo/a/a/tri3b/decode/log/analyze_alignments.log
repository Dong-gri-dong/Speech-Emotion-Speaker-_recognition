The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 37.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 63.0% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 1.9% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 9.0 hours of data, or 5.6 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 1.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (12,17.2,47)

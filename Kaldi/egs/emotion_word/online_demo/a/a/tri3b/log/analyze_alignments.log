The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 39.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 62.4% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 3.7% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 77.6 hours of data, or 47.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 1.4% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (22,23.5,54)

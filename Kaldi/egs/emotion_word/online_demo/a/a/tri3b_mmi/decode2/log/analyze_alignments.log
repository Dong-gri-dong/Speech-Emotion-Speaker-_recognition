The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 37.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 63.5% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 2.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 9.0 hours of data, or 5.6 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 1.1% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (12,17.4,47)
